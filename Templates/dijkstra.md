# Dijkstra’s algorithm (Shortest Path)

## Implementation:

- Use an instance variable keep track of the total cost from the start node to each destination
- The instance variable will contain the current total weight of the smallest weight path from the start to the vertex in question
- The algorithm iterates once for every vertex in the graph (order is in priority queue)
- The PriorityQueue class stores tuples of key, value pairs
    - the key in the priority queue must match the key of the vertex in the graph
    - the value is used for deciding the priority, and thus the position of the key in the priority queue


***Essentially, this is a BFS using priority queue instead of queue***

## Template

First check the graph traversal template [**HERE**](./graph_traversal.md) if you haven't seen the graph traversal. It is highly recommended that you fully understand the graph traversal first.

```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush

heap = [[0, start]]
seen = set()
while heap:
    # Use dist to set priority, and vertex is the value that stores the info
    dist, vertex = heappop(heap)  
    if vertex not in seen:
        seen.add(vertex)
        if vertex == end:
            return dist
        for end_vertex in vertices[vertex]:
            if end_vertex not in seen:
                heappush(heap, [dist+1, end_vertex])
```

Note that above template doesn't iterate through the entire maze or graph or whatever input you received. 
This is simply because shortest path normally have a start point and an end point, so we just need to start from the start point, no need to check all points.
