# The Coding Interview Guide

    This is a collection of my notes when I was/am studying for interviews and it is also
    intended to become a systematic guide for people who would like to become a software 
    development engineer.

    I was graduated as an Electrical Engineer and after working for about 2 years as Electrical
    Engineer I decided to become a Software Engineer. I have taught myself all the most common
    data structures and algorithms, machine learning fundamentals, and backend architectures.

    During my learning journey, I found that I learned all the knowledge piece by piece 
    when I need them, but I was always lack of a systematic understanding/overview of the 
    algorithms or a tech-stack. And since I made lots of notes, I think its necessary to 
    summarize them and make them a systematic guide for whoever wants to become a software 
    development engineer.

    Hope this repo is helpful and best of luck to you!
