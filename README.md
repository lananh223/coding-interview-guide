# The Coding Interview Guide

> This is a collection of my notes when I was/am studying for interviews and it is also
> intended to become a systematic guide for people who would like to become a software 
> development engineer.

> I was graduated as an Electrical Engineer and after working for about 2 years as Electrical
> Engineer I decided to become a Software Engineer. I have taught myself all the most common
> data structures and algorithms, machine learning fundamentals, and backend architectures.

> During my learning journey, I found that I learned all the knowledge piece by piece 
> when I need them, but I was always lack of a systematic understanding/overview of the 
> algorithms or a tech-stack. And since I made lots of notes, I think its necessary to 
> summarize them and make them a systematic guide for whoever wants to become a software 
> development engineer.

> Hope this repo is helpful and best of luck to you!

# A bit more about myself

I was graduated from a traditional Electrical Engineering program (Yes I don't have a CS/CE degree)
and after that I finished a graduate degree in nano-photonics. 

The only programming courses I took in school was a C++ introductory course in my first year of 
undergrad, and an assembly language course on my third year (EE mandatory). I learnt all the other 
programming languages and more all by myself and I understand how painful or missing direction this
could be. 

In this repo I'm going to show you how to get started for people who want to switch career 
or who want to improve on the interviewing technics or revisit the fundamentals.

- I'll be giving resources that I learnt 
- I'll be sharing the tips and tricks on how to practice on the algorithms
- I'll talk about various areas of software development
- I'll be sharing the technics for Behavior Questions (BQs)

Most importantly, learning is a life long journey, and I'm still learning everyday.
Hopefully you can learn with me, and I can help people getting into the field more easily
or improve their technical abilities.

# Before get started, REMEMBER the following facts

- **Programming is about writing the code, not reading**. So don't just read, IMPLEMENT it!
- **You can't memorize everything at the first time**. So keep repeating and practicing, and WRITE them down!
- **Don't feel you aren't smart enough**. In fact a lot of programming questions are tricky since you've never seen them before. Once you've seen enough, you'll know the tricks.
- **Review, review, review**. Review your code and your notes once a while, try to refactor/optimize your code, and refresh your memories about the fundamentals.
- **Learning is a life lon journey**. So keep learning and reading!

Above points are really really important, keep these in mind and they'll help you in your career.

Now let's get started!
